# What about equations?
We can learn 
The h<sub>&theta;</sub>(x) = &theta;<sub>o</sub> x + &theta;<sub>1</sub>x
Or use LaTeX from external renderer: `https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php` (as SVG)
With LaTeX code:

```G = \sum_i^N a_i w_i + \frac{1}{2}\frac{S+\varphi}{a_\textrm{CdTe}} g_{\textrm{Mn}}```

we get:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{150}&space;\bg_white&space;G&space;=&space;\sum_i^N&space;a_i&space;w_i&space;&plus;&space;\frac{1}{2}\frac{S&plus;\varphi}{a_\textrm{CdTe}}&space;g_{\textrm{Mn}}" title="G = \sum_i^N a_i w_i + \frac{1}{2}\frac{S+\varphi}{a_\textrm{CdTe}} g_{\textrm{Mn}}" />
